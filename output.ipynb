        "  - lack of authorship can affect career prospects\n",
        "\n",
        "- While new credit systems aim to be more inclusive towards more contribution types, they still suffer from two key problems.\n",

        "\t- further, developer account information may be slightly different from publication information (preferred name / legal name), username’s, etc\n",
        "\t- a fine-tuned transformer model enables us to connect accounts which have similar enough information, hopefully providing us with many more author-code-contributor matches than would be possible on exact name or email address matching alone\n",

        "- Our predictive model serves two primary purposes: identifying authors who directly contribute to an article’s associated codebase, and, revealing developers who were not included on the article’s authorship list.\n",
        "\t- while predictive, it is grounded in the commit logs of source code repositories, no longer self reported\n",
        "\t- individuals who have been left off can at least for now be identified by their developer account\n",

        "- Further, by applying our model across a large corpora of paired research articles and source code repositories, we enable objective insight into the software development dynamics of research teams.\n",

        "\t- Each data source (the journals and publication platforms) either requires or recommends the sharing of code repositories related to a piece of work at the time of publication.\n",
