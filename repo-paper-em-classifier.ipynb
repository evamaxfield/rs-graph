To download it, run:\\n\\n```bash\\nrs-graph-data download\\n```\\n\\nThis will always download the latest version of the data (as pushed by @evamaxfield).\\n\\n## Order of Data Operations\\n\\nIf this project was starting from scratch, the order of operations to recreate our work\\nwould be:\\n\\n**Note:** at each step of the process, the data or model is cached\\nto the installed package directory (`rs_graph.data.files`).\\n\\n1. Get all data sources using the command: `rs-graph-sources get-all`\\n2. Options\\n    1. Get all recursive upstream dependencies for the repos:\\n        `rs-graph-enrichment get-upstreams`\\n    2. Get all of the extended paper details for the papers:\\n        `rs-graph-enrichment get-extended-paper-details`\\n    3. Get top 30 contributors to each repository:\\n        `rs-graph-enrichment get-repo-contributors`\\n    4. Train github user to author entity matching model:\\n        `rs-graph-modeling train-developer-author-em-classifier`\\n    5. Match devs and authors using trained predictive model:\\n        `rs-graph-enrichment match-devs-and-authors`\\n\\n## GitHub User and Author Entity Matching Model\\n\\n### IRR Annotation\\n\\nFrom the 2023-12-12 upload of the full dataset, we randomly sampled 100 rows to\\nuse for three-way annotator-agreement and alignment.\\n\\nAnnotation criteria for entity matches are:\\n\\n1. `dev_details` name, username, or email is the same or incredibly\\n    similar to the `author_details` name. specifically:\\n\\n    1.  if the provided name in the `dev_details` is the same name as the\\n        author name from the `author_details` (or incredibly similar)\\n    \\n    or:\\n\\n    2.  if no name is provided in the `dev_details` but the GitHub username\\n        or the email within `dev_details` looks similar to the\\n        author name from `author_details`\\n\\n2.  there is no co-author (names) or co-contributor (usernames) which look\\n    like a potentially better match.\\n\\n3. if there is uncertainty, err on the side of `False`\\n\\n#### Results of IRR\\n\\nInter-rater Reliability (Fleiss Kappa): 0.925595238095238 (Almost perfect agreement)\\n\\nTo reproduce this result run: `rs-graph-modeling calculate-irr-for-dev-author-em-annotation`\\n\\n#### Examples\\n\\n##### No Match -- No Name Provided, GitHub Username or Email not Similar to Author Name\\n\\n| dev_details \\t| author_details \\t| match \\t|\\n|---\\t|---\\t|---\\t|\\n| username: ideas-man;<br>name: None;<br>email: None;<br>repos: https://github.com/DLR-RM/BlenderProc;<br>co_contributors: themasterlink, cornerfarmer, MartinSmeyer, mayman99, wboerdijk, joe3141, MarkusKnauer, Sebastian-Jung, 5trobl, thodan, probabilisticrobotics, mansoorcheema, DavidRisch, apenzko, abahnasy, maximilianmuehlbauer, moizsajid, Victorlouisdg, hansaskov, wangg12, MarwinNumbers, harinandan1995, neixlo, zzilch, cuteday, andrewyguo, jascase901, HectorAnadon, beekama; \\t| name: Klaus H.

Before creating the interaction, we created embeddings for each of the four values above using sentence transformers. After interaction we are left with three features (username * name), (name * name), and (email * name). We then trained a logistic regression model on these features to predict whether or not the dev and author are the same person.\\n\\n### Model Evaluation\\n\\nWe evaluated the model using 10-fold cross validation. We achieved an average F1 score of 0.97.\\n\\n![Dev Author Entity Matching Model Confusion Matrix](./docs/dev-author-confusion-matrix-docs.png)\\n\\n### Model Application\\n\\nWe then applied the model across pairs of authors and devs which have worked on the same repositories. In doing so, we found ~3,200 matches between authors and devs.'"
