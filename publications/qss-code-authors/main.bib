Accordingly, many different participants need insight into how to understand the relationship between software, its development, its use, and its scientific impact. In this article, we draw on interviews and participant observation to describe the information needs of domain scientists, software component producers, infrastructure providers, and ecosystem stewards, including science funders. We provide a framework by which to categorize different types of measures and their relationships as they reach around from funding, development, scientific use, and through to scientific impact. We use this framework to organize a presentation of existing measures and techniques, and to identify areas in which techniques are either not widespread, or are entirely missing. We conclude with policy recommendations designed to improve insight into the scientific software ecosystem, make it more understandable, and thereby contribute to the progress of science.},

abstract = {Software plays an increasingly critical role in science, including data analysis, simulations, and managing workflows. Unlike other technologies supporting science, software can be copied and distributed at essentially no cost, potentially opening the door to unprecedented levels of sharing and collaborative innovation. Yet we do not have a clear picture of how software development for science fits into the day-to-day practice of science, or how well the methods and incentives of its production facilitate realization of this potential. We report the results of a multiple-case study of software development in three fields: high energy physics, structural biology, and microbiology. In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.},

abstract = {Continuous integration (CI) is a well-established technique in commercial and open-source software projects, although not routinely used in scientific publishing. In the scientific software context, CI can serve two functions to increase reproducibility of scientific results: providing an established platform for testing the reproducibility of these results, and demonstrating to other scientists how the code and data generate the published results. We explore scientific software testing and CI strategies using two articles published in the areas of applied mathematics and computational physics. We discuss lessons learned from reproducing these articles as well as examine and discuss existing tests. We introduce the notion of a "scientific test" as one that produces computational results from a published article. We then consider full result reproduction within a CI environment. If authors find their work too time or resource intensive to easily adapt to a CI context, we recommend the inclusion of results from reduced versions of their work (e.g., run at lower resolution, with shorter time scales, with smaller data sets) alongside their primary results within their article. While these smaller versions may be less interesting scientifically, they can serve to verify that published code and data are working properly. We demonstrate such reduction tests on the two articles studied.},

abstract="The definition of scholarly content has expanded to include the data and source code that contribute to a publication. While major archiving efforts to preserve conventional scholarly content, typically in PDFs (e.g., LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, Portico), are underway, no analogous effort has yet emerged to preserve the data and code referenced in those PDFs, particularly the scholarly code hosted online on Git Hosting Platforms (GHPs). Similarly, the Software Heritage Foundation is working to archive public source code, but there is value in archiving the issue threads, pull requests, and wikis that provide important context to the code while maintaining their original URLs. In current implementations, source code and its ephemera are not preserved, which presents a problem for scholarly projects where reproducibility matters. To understand and quantify the scope of this issue, we analyzed the use of GHP URIs in the arXiv and PMC corpora from January 2007 to December 2021. In total, there were 253,590 URIs to GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket, and GitLab repositories across the 2.66 million publications in the corpora. We found that GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and Bitbucket were collectively linked to 160 times in 2007 and 76,746 times in 2021. In 2021, one out of five publications in the arXiv corpus included a URI to GitHub. The complexity of GHPs like GitHub is not amenable to conventional Web archiving techniques. Therefore, the growing use of GHPs in scholarly publications points to an urgent and growing need for dedicated efforts to archive their holdings in order to preserve research code and its scholarly ephemera.",

Using unique survey data from over 2000 life scientists, we find that the predictors of authorship differ from those of inventorship. A wider range of project contributions may result in authorship, and social factors appear to play a larger role in authorship decisions than in inventorship decisions. We also find evidence that project contributions and social factors interact in predicting authorship, suggesting that the two sets of factors should be considered jointly rather than seen as independent determinants of attribution. In addition to providing novel insights into the functioning of the authorship and inventorship system, our results have important implications for administrators, managers, and policy makers, as well as for innovation scholars who often rely on patents and publications as measures of scientists’ performance.}

abstract = {Authorship is rife with injustice and malpractice, with women expressing concerns about the fair attribution of credit. Authorship is the primary form of symbolic capital in science. Despite this, authorship is rife with injustice and malpractice, with women expressing concerns regarding the fair attribution of credit. Based on an international survey, we examine gendered practices in authorship communication, disagreement, and fairness. Our results demonstrate that women were more likely to experience authorship disagreements and experience them more often. Their contributions to research papers were more often devalued by both men and women. Women were more likely to discuss authorship with coauthors at the beginning of the project, whereas men were more likely to determine authorship unilaterally at the end. Women perceived that they received less credit than deserved, while men reported the opposite. This devaluation of women’s work in science creates cumulative disadvantages in scientific careers. Open discussion regarding power dynamics related to gender is necessary to develop more equitable distribution of credit for scientific labor.}}

abstract = {What do contribution statements on articles tell us that author order does not—and how can they be improved? Most scientific research is performed by teams, and for a long time, observers have inferred individual team members’ contributions by interpreting author order on published articles. In response to increasing concerns about this approach, journals are adopting policies that require the disclosure of individual authors’ contributions. However, it is not clear whether and how these disclosures improve upon the conventional approach. Moreover, there is little evidence on how contribution statements are written and how they are used by readers. We begin to address these questions in two studies. Guided by a conceptual model, Study 1 examines the relationship between author order and contribution statements on more than 12,000 articles to understand what information is provided by each. This analysis quantifies the risk of error when inferring contributions from author order and shows how this risk increases with team size and for certain types of authors. At the same time, the analysis suggests that some components of the value of contributions are reflected in author order but not in currently used contribution statements. Complementing the bibliometric analysis, Study 2 analyzes survey data from more than 6000 corresponding authors to examine how contribution statements are written and used. This analysis highlights important differences between fields and between senior versus junior scientists, as well as strongly diverging views about the benefits and limitations of contribution statements. On the basis of both studies, we highlight important avenues for future research and consider implications for a broad range of stakeholders.}}

abstract = {The disruption (D) index is a network-based indicator to quantify the extent to which a focal paper disrupts its predecessors. This study focuses on what disruption means by examining example articles related to “sleeping beauties in science” and frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). We investigated the structure of the citation network and subsequent papers’ motivations for citing the focal papers. Based on the observation that conceptual work is more likely to disrupt science than technical work, we hypothesize that disruption reflects the mechanism of how paradigms shift in the development of science. We also assume that the disruption identified by the D index indicates more than generating a new direction. Disruptive contributions include revolutionary studies such as Nobel-prize-winning papers, as suggested in previous work. However, disruptive contributions also include scientific dissemination of new terminology created by popular proposals, such as “sleeping beauties in science.” Such contributions redefine and popularize phenomena in science.}

On the one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This paper gives overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasize on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogenous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data cannot be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions.},

This study explores differences between female-led and male-led teams in terms of scientific impact, novelty, and disruption, utilizing a comprehensive data set of journal articles spanning from 1980 to 2016 across STEM fields. We employed Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to match female and male scientists based on their characteristics. Subsequently, we applied multivariable logistic regression models to compare the outcomes of journal articles produced by female-led and male-led teams. Our analysis reveals that female-led teams generate more novel and disruptive ideas. However, they tend to produce articles with less scientific impact compared to their male-led counterparts. This suggests a systemic undervaluation of the contributions of female scientists. Further analysis indicates that this gender bias intensifies in later career stages and with larger team sizes. Additionally, significant field-specific heterogeneity is observed, with the most pronounced bias found in Biology and Medicine. These findings highlight the urgent need for policy adjustments to address these biases and promote a more equitable evaluation system in scientific research.},

abstract = {Open source package repositories have become a crucial component of the modern software supply chain since they enable developers to easily and rapidly import code written by others. However, low quality, poorly vetted code residing in such repositories exposes developers and end-users to dangerous bugs and vulnerabilities at a large scale. Such issues have recently led to the creation of government-backed verification standards pertaining to packages, as well as a significant body of developer folklore regarding what constitutes a reliable package. However, there exists little academic research assessing the relationships between recommended development practices and known package issues in this domain. Motivated by this gap in understanding, we conduct a large-scale study that formally evaluates whether adherence to these guidelines meaningfully impacts reported issues and bug maintenance activity across the most widely utilized npm packages (encompassing 7,162 packages with over 100K weekly downloads each), which unveiled wide disparities across package-level metrics. We find that it is only recommendations pertaining to a broad notion of scrutiny that provide strong and reliable insights into the reporting and resolving of package issues. These findings pose significant implications for developers, who seek to identify well-maintained packages for use, as well as security researchers, who seek to identify suspicious packages for critical observation.},

abstract = {Objectives
We explored how readers interpret authors' roles based on authorship order and corresponding author.
Study Design and Setting
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of all 291 Surgical and Medical Chairpersons across North America. We developed hypothetical study and authorship bylines with five authors varying the corresponding author as first or last author. Respondents reported their perceptions about the authors' roles in the study and the most prestigious authorship position. We used multinomial regression to explore the results.
Results
One hundred sixty-five chairpersons (response rate: 57%) completed our survey. When the first author was designated as corresponding author, most of the respondents assumed that this author had taken the lead in study design (55.3%) and analysis and interpretation of data (51.2%). When the last author (fifth) was designated as corresponding, perceptions of the first author's role in study concept and design (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15, 0.41) and analysis and interpretation of results (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.13, 0.38) decreased significantly. Overall prestige of the last author position increased significantly when designated as corresponding author (OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 2.4, 6.4).
Conclusions
Academic department chairs' perception of authors' contributions was influenced by corresponding author designation. Without authors' explicit contributions in research articles, many readers may draw false conclusions about author credit and accountability.}

The actual quality and usage of these repositories are, however, to a large degree unknown so far. In this paper, we present for the first time a thorough analysis of all GitHub code repositories linked in scientific papers using the Microsoft Academic Graph as a data source. We analyze the repositories and their associated papers with respect to various dimensions. We observe that the number of stars and forks, respectively, over all repositories follows a power-law distribution. In the majority of cases, only one person from the authors is contributing to the repository. The GitHub manuals are mostly kept rather short with few sentences. The source code is mostly provided in Python. The papers containing the repository URLs as well as the papers' authors are typically from the AI field.},

However, aligning the link between GitHub repositories and academic papers can prove difficult, and the current practice of establishing and maintaining such links remains unknown. This paper investigates the role of academic paper references contained in these repositories. We conduct a large-scale study of 20 thousand GitHub repositories that make references to academic papers. We use a mixed-methods approach to identify public access, traceability and evolutionary aspects of the links. Although referencing a paper is not typical, we find that a vast majority of referenced academic papers are public access. These repositories tend to be affiliated with academic communities. More than half of the papers do not link back to any repository. We find that academic papers from top-tier SE venues are not likely to reference a repository, but when they do, they usually link to a GitHub software repository. In a network of arXiv papers and referenced repositories, we find that the most referenced papers are (i) highly-cited in academia and (ii) are referenced by repositories written in different programming languages.}
