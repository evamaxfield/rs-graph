    "text": "3.2 A Predictive Model for Matching Article Authors and Source Code Contributors\n\n3.2.1 Annotated Dataset Creation\n\nThe development of an accurate author-developer matching model requires high-quality labeled training data that captures the complexity of real-world identity matching.\n\nentity matching between authors and developers is non-trivial\nmultiple forms of name variation and incomplete information\nneed to expand on specific matching challenges\nadd figure showing example matches/non-matches\n\nWe developed an annotation process to create a robust training dataset while maximizing efficiency and accuracy.\n\nfocus on JOSS articles to increase positive match density\nwe create author-developer pairs for annotation by creating all possible combinations of authors and developers within a single JOSS article-repository pair\nwe take a random sample of 3000 pairs from the full set and have two independent annotators label each\nstructured conflict resolution process\nneed to add details about annotation guidelines/criteria\n\nThe resulting annotated dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for training our predictive model while highlighting common patterns in author-developer identity matching.\n\nafter resolution of all annotated pairs, our annotated dataset contains 451 (15.0%) positive and 2548 (85.0%) negative author-developer-account pairs\nthere are 2027 unique authors and 2733 unique developer accounts within this annotated set\nhowever, not all developer accounts contain complete information, in our set 2191 (80.2%) have associated names and 839 (30.7%) have associated emails\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Training and Evaluation\n\nTo optimize our predictive model for author-contributor matching, we evaluate a variety of Transformer-based base models and input features.\n\nmultiple transformer base models available\nvarious potential feature combinations\n\nWe employed a systematic evaluation to identify optimal combination of base models and input features.\n\nfirst, to ensure that there was no data leakage, we split our dataset into training and test sets\nspecifically, we created two random sets of 10% of all unique authors and 10% of all unique developers, any pairs containing either the author or developer were placed into the test set\nin doing so, we ensured that the model was never trained on any author or developer information later used for evaluation\ndue to the fact that each author and developer-account can be included in multiple annotated pairs, our final training set contains 2442 (81.4%) and our test set contains 557 (18.6%) author-developer-account pairs\nwe used three different transformer models as our fine-tuning bases and fine-tuned each using all combinations of avaiable developer-account features, from including only the developer account username to including the developer’s username, name, and email.\nto avoid overfitting and ensure generalizability, we fine-tuned each of the base models for only a single training epoch.\nmodel evaluation was performed using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score\n\nAfter extensive model comparison we find that fine-tuning from Microsoft’s deberta-v3-base and including only the developer’s username and name achieves the best performance for author-developer matching.\n\nour best model achieves a binary F1 score of 0.944, with an accuracy of 0.984, precision of 0.938, and recall of 0.95 (see Figure 1 for a confusion matrix of model predictions on the test set).\nanalysis of feature importance\n\nnote that the addition of developer’s name has a “larger effect” on model performance but that could simply be because of how many more developers have a name available than an email\nalso note that there is a model that performs just as well as this one using bert-multilingual and includes the developers email however we choose to use the deberta and name only version for its simplicity as well as the fact that deberta is a much more recently developed and released model which was pre-trained on a much larger dataset (including multilingual data).\nconsidering that in most cases, deberta out-performs bert-multilingual, we believe that while the overall evaluation metrics between the top two performing models are the same, the deberta based model will generalize to other unseen data better than the bert-multilingual model\n\nall model and feature set combination results are available in Table 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Confusion Matrix Produced From Evaluation of Best Performing Model (deberta-v3 with developer username, developer name, and author name).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo enable future research, we have made our trained model and supporting application library publicly available.\n\nPython library implementation\nHuggingFace model deployment"

is a commonly used tool in scientometrics\nsimilarly, metrics of “scientific impact” such as h-index, i10 index, and two-year mean citedness are also available to us.\nplot / table of the distributions between coding and non-coding authors\nANOVA / Chi2 tests to see if these differences are significant\nresults in summary\n\nJust as before, we next investigate if these results are affected by article type and research domain.\n\nsubplot + stats tests for differences by each article type\nsubplot + stats tests for differences by each domain\nresults in summary\n\n\n\n4.2.1

Social sciences is split, and social science is broad so this may be a “qual” vs “quant” split, if you include mixed methods researchers in there its hard to parse.\nPhysical sciences being entirely non-significant is interesting because a majority of our data comes from Physical sciences. this could indicate that coding is just a part of the culture and doesn’t have a significant impact on citations (which is inline with CS being the bulk of our physical sciences data).\n\n\n4.2.3.3 Article Type\n\n\n\n\nTable 9: Researcher H-Index by Coding Status Controlled by Most Freq.
